BREAKDOWN:

- Create squares object and main function definition
- Declare a variable n equal to whatever user input is 
- Create a variable sumSquares equal to range of 1 until n where each value is squared (using map)
- Print the result (since scala obj implicitly returns, an explicit return not needed )
